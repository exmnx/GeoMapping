# GeoMapping
This was created for fun to help with travel plans I had. The map graphs all locations on the data sheet, and creates 1 mile circles for every ward listed per prefecture using latitude and longitude. 

**Excel Sheet**
The excel sheet will be updating. The geomap using folium only includes the first sheet of the excel workbook. The sheets are as listed below:
  - Trip Overview: Main data that includes region, place name, GPS location, etc. 
  - Location Sheet: Shows a pivot table based on the trip overview data. Groups name of place based on columns: Wards and Located in
  - Trip Itinerary: The trip itinerary showing how many nights and days staying
  - Habitation: Lists Possible places to stay  
  - Prices: a hypothesized price sheet 
  - Metro:

This shows the python code used to create the map.
